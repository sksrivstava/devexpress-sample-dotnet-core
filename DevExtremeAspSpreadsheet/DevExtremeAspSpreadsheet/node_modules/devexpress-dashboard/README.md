## About

DevExpress Web Dashboard allows you to create and customize dashboards on the web. This npm packet is based on the client-server model and represents a client (frontend) part that includes all the necessary styles, scripts and HTML-templates. That is, you need to create a server (backend) project.

## Install
The devexpress-dashboard npm package references **devextreme** and **@devexpress/analytics-core** as [peerDependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies). Since npm v3 and higher, peerDependencies should be installed manually. This allows developers to control a version of the peerDependencies packages and guarantees that the package is installed once.

To install with `npm`, run the following command:

```shell
npm install devextreme @devexpress/analytics-core devexpress-dashboard --save
```

Note that versions of the **devexpress-\*** npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same). If the versions are different, npm shows a warning after the package is installed.
